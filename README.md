Might be useful for someone out there.

PHP Login System using three separed classes.
One for the User and it's functions, one for Database and one for Sessions.

What it can do?
* Can spawn on multiple sessions, which means user can destroy any session they want
* Can easily be implemented on any system, just need to now the right methods to call.
* Works on almost any scenario

What it can't do?
* Start an intergalatic war

Keep in mind:
This is just a prototype for a login system, it has _some_ security features, but lacks for some details. If you want to use it production you should change some parts of the code to keep it secure.

It still has some things I want to change/add to. So it _might_ be updated any time soon.

Well, 
Hope this helps.
